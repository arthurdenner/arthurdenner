Hi! :wave:

ðŸ’» Front-End Domain Architect at [Kindred Group](https://www.kindredgroup.com/).

I prefer to describe myself as a Full Cycle Developer who is involved in every step of the process, from the concept to the implementation and monitoring.
I also think that Developer Experience (DX) plays a big role in our productivity, so I enjoy working on bundlers, linters and libraries for other developers.

Learning new things and sharing knowledge is important to me, which is why I have a [blog](https://arthurdenner.hashnode.dev/) and a [newsletter](https://buttondown.email/arthurdenner).
In my current role, I'm building a new platform around our microfront-end architecture and helping teams on their front-end projects.
Outside of my working hours, I work on side projects and open-source to develop new skills.
