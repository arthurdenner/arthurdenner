Hi! :wave:

I'm Arthur, a Software Engineer passionated by projects that make great impact on its users.

My main interests are JavaScript/TypeScript, Node, MongoDB, React/React Native, Flutter and GraphQL.

Most of my professional experience is on front-end, but I have open-source and side projects where I develop my back-end and mobile skills.

I also share some of my learnings through [my newsletter](https://buttondown.email/arthurdenner) and my [blog](https://arthurdenner.hashnode.dev).

ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· &nbsp; From MaceiÃ³, Alagoas, Brazil

ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª &nbsp; Living in Stockholm, Sweden

## Side projects

- [Quanto Custa](https://quantocusta.netlify.app)

A free app where citizens from Alagoas - the state I come from - can search for products and fuel prices.

It's my pet project. Whenever I want to learn something new, I try to apply that knowledge in some part of this project to make it even better!
